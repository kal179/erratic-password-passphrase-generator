# erratic-password-passphrase-generator
Alright people this is my first <i>web-based full fledged project</i>. <br/>

A random password/passphrase generator, and related text and article.  <br/>
Implemented using Html, Css, Php and Js. <br/>
<br/>
<b>FILES:</b>
<pre>
<strong> index.html </strong>  contains main content and user-interaction 
<strong> passphrase_gen.php </strong>  contains response file for random passphrase generation 
<strong> passwd_gen.php </strong>  contains response file for random password generation  
<strong> JS, CSS </strong> and relative files are still under development! 
</pre>

<br/>

<pre>
Please Note currently password is generated on server using PHP and sent over internet to users browser.
Password generation on browser itself is still to be added!

<b>BUILD IN PROGRESS...</b>
</pre>

<br/>
<strong>I'd love to hear suggestions, reviews, edits, etc! <br/>
